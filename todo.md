- register screen
- if logged out, not through logout button. State will be persisted. Need to compare login response account id to persisted state account id and purge state if not equal
- profile page ie: password change
- getAllMonth needs to check cache
- error handling
- home screen expense list column headers should stick - tried unable to get scroll inside datatable
- check other input screens for keyboard awareness
